# Pascangle

## This is a console-based program in C that will emulate pascals triangle based on a changing height that the user can control with the arrow up or down key

It was great fun going over the basics in C again including:
* input/ output
* C data type semantics(uint64_t etc)
* Procedural oriented programming in C
